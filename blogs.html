                <h3 >How to Stop Catastrophizing</h3>
                <p>All of us jump to the worst-case scenario at times. Our loved one doesn’t text and we fear they were in an accident. We make a mistake at work and worry we’ll be fired. Our partner is unhappy and we think they’re going to leave us. Catastrophizing isn’t all bad. Being able to imagine the worst can help us avoid it, like when I put antibiotic ointment on my cut to avoid a trip to the ER. </p>
                <p>If you find that your mind is creating disaster scenarios, it’s nothing to feel bad about, even if you know it makes no sense. Your brain is just trying to keep you safe. So say a silent “thank you” to your brain: “I see what you did there, trying to keep me safe and alive.”

                    Then remember that you don’t have to take everything you think seriously. You might even find some humor in the stories the mind concocts. Acknowledge that the catastrophe is one possible outcome, then come back to what’s real in your life right at this moment.

                <h3 >Daily Habits to Help Reduce Stress</h3>
                <p>It is been a tough few weeks. Our hospitals have become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, and deaths rates are rising. Vaccine distribution has been slower than we had hoped. And then there was the chaotic, disturbing event at the Capitol. On top of all of that, there are the daily questions: How can I stay safe? When will I be able to see my family and friends?  How long till we get back to normal?

                    Any of the issues, alone, would stress us out -- but right now, everything seems to be happening at once.
                    
                    The question is, how do we stay sane and grounded at this time? And how do we help our families do the same?
                    
                    I rely on three simple daily rituals to help myself stay calm during challenging times.</p>
                    <p>
                    Set my intention. The first thing I do every morning, before I even get my coffee, is to think about my intention for the day. What will be my "main theme" of the day? Aiming my focus like this not only helps me prioritize, but it also puts me at the steering wheel. Often it can feel like life is dragging us around, but setting an intention like this can help us have control over what we want to do with the day that is given to us. Your intention might be to focus on your job and make a dent in a project, or perhaps it's self-care and making calls for doctors' appointments. Recently, my intentions have been to make progress on a project at work and to be present for my kids. Having a focus or intention helps me have a North Star for the day so I don’t get stuck mentally.

                <h3 >ADHD: Advice for Newly Diagnosed Families</h3>
                <p>The first thing to do when your child gets an ADHD diagnosis is to take a deep breath. That’s also the second, third, and fourth things to do. This is especially true if it feels like a shock or confirmation of your worst fears. I promise you: It isn’t as bad as all that.

                    For families who are old hands with the condition, the response might be, “Well, duh” or “Yep, her too” – that level of blasé may feel beyond you right now, but remember that ADHD is at its worst when you don’t know that that is what’s making your life harder and therefore don’t know what to do to make things better. The good news about an accurate diagnosis is that it puts us in a much better position to identify the strategies that are most likely to be effective. As I often say, knowledge is power.</p>
                    <p>The next thing to do with a new diagnosis is to educate yourself about it – with no pressure to do anything with that information yet. Just gather information and try to wrap your brain around what ADHD is (and isn’t). You’ll probably find that a lot of things that didn’t make sense before, suddenly make sense when seen through the lens of ADHD. As in, “No wonder he did so well with the hardest math teacher that he really liked, but kind of tanked that easy but boring social studies class.” It can feel like getting to the last chapter in the mystery novel when suddenly all the random bits and pieces fall into place and make sense.</p>

                <h3 >What Not to Say to Someone Struggling With Mental Health</h3>
                <p>Many patients have described to me the unhelpful comments they’ve had to deal with. I’ve been on the receiving end of some of these remarks, too, when I’ve shared my struggles with depression or insomnia.

                    Responses like the following miss the mark because in one way or another, they invalidate the other person’s experience.</p>
                    <p>
                        “I Know How You Feel.” This kind of comment is usually meant to express empathy, but paradoxically it often does the opposite. When we suggest that we know how someone is feeling, we superimpose our experience onto theirs. Even if we’ve had similar struggles with our mental health, we never know exactly what it’s like for someone else.
                    
                     
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>“Do What I Did.” For those of us who have had our own mental and emotional struggles, it’s tempting to tell the person to do what we found helpful. “Just do this. Just think like this.” But as with saying, “I know how you feel,” this response assumes that our experiences are the same and that what worked for us will work for the other person. In reality, they might need a different approach.</p>
